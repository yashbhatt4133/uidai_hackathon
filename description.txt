The UIDAI Data Hackathon 2026 project focuses on extracting actionable insights from anonymized Aadhaar enrollment, demographic update, and biometric update datasets. With over 1.3 billion Aadhaar numbers issued and billions of monthly transactions, Aadhaar data represents a rich source of information about citizen interaction with digital governance systems. However, raw data alone does not convey meaningful understanding unless systematically analyzed.

This project performs a comprehensive exploratory and comparative analysis across time, geography, and age groups to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies in Aadhaar-related activities. The analysis examines how enrollments and updates vary across states, districts, and regions, identifying spikes that may result from migration, welfare scheme linkages, infrastructure improvements, or administrative campaigns. Age-wise segmentation helps interpret lifecycle-driven behavior, such as child enrollments, adult updates, and biometric re-captures.

A structured methodology is followed, beginning with data aggregation, cleaning, and standardization to resolve inconsistencies in state and district naming. Pin-code-based reverse mapping is used to ensure geographical accuracy. Feature engineering adds temporal and regional dimensions, enabling deeper interpretation through trend, descriptive, and geographical analysis.

The project ultimately aims to support informed decision-making by highlighting areas of high activity, potential exclusion risks, and operational inefficiencies. By converting Aadhaar transaction data into clear analytical insights, the solution demonstrates how large-scale digital identity data can be responsibly leveraged to strengthen governance, improve service delivery, and enhance the inclusiveness of India’s digital public infrastructure.
